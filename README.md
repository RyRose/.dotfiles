# My dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. To use, install [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow) and clone this repository to the home directory. Then, with this repo as your current working directory, run the following to symlink each dotfile within to their appropriate location:

```sh
stow .
```
